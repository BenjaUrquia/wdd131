                    <li><strong>Deck:</strong> Spanish-shuffle of 40 cards (without 8, 9 and joker).</li>

            <h4>Modalities:</h4>
            <p class="text"><strong>Two player games (1v1):</strong> One plays against the other</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Four player games (2v2):</strong> Two couples playing against each other seated alternately around the table.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Six player games (3v3):</strong> Two couples playing against each other seated alternately around the table.</p>

            <h4>Order and value of the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">The card order is used for the Truco and determines the winner of the hand. Card value is used for the Flor and Envido bets.</p>
            <p class="text">There are four special cards in Truco, known as “cartas bravas” (wild cards) and these are the highest in the pack. The rank of these cards, from highest to lowest, are: ace of swords (espadilla), ace of clubs (bastillo), seven of swords and seven of coins (wild sevens). For the rest, the rank, from highest to lowest, is: threes, deuces, false aces (ace of coins and cups), black cards (kings, knights and jacks) false sevens (seven of cups and clubs), sixes, fives and fours.</p>
            <p class="text">The value of the cards, for Flor and Envido, is: black cards score 0 points each and the other cards, their pip values.</p>

            <h4>Dealing the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">Before beginning a game, cards are normally drawn to determine who will be the first to deal. The turn to be dealer is in rotating order, going anticlockwise.</p>
            
            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p class="text">The player on the dealer's right is the “hand” and has certain privileges in the game, as well as being the first to play. The “hand” starts the game, announcing Flor, if they have it, betting Envido or playing one of their cards, but regardless of what they do, each player in turn also has these three options until a card is played, at which point the Truco phase of the game starts and it is no longer possible to bid Flor or Envido, although players can still respond to these. Once the bets have been settled, the cards are played to determine the winner of the Truco. After finishing this, the scores for the partial game are noted. A player or team is said to be fishing when they remain silent waiting for their opponents to be the first to bet or Truco in order to respond.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 ANNOUNCEMENTS</h5>
            <p class="text-2">The Flor and the Envido have to be announced during the first trick, and the Truco at any time during the hand. As Flor has to be announced first, if the first player does not have it and does not want to bet on Envido, they can play a card to initiate the Truco phase or even announce Truco before playing the card. Subsequent players can bet on Flor or Envido but before responding to the Truco bet, otherwise they lose the option to do so. When one of the players bets on Envido, the others have the opportunity to respond to that bet, even if they have played their first card, however, there are no more Envido bets after everyone has played their first card.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 TRUCO HANDS</h5>
            <p class="text-2">The three ways of scoring points in Truco are:</p>
            <nav class="truco-nav-2">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Envido:</strong>Any player can bet or respond to an Envido bet. Both the bets and responses are made on behalf of the team. A player cannot bet on Envido after they have played their first card or after they have bet or accepted a Truco bet. If a player bets on Truco before an opponent says “envido”, that player can still reply to their Envido bet, only responding to the Truco bet after the Envido betting has finished. If a player has two cards of the same suit, the hand is worth the sum of these two cards, plus 20 but if the three cards are different suits, the hand is worth the value of the highest card. Meaning that the highest Envido is worth 33 points and the lowest, three different black cards, is worth 0 points. To bet on Envido it is necessary to say:
                        <strong>Envido.</strong> Worth 2 points.
                        <strong>Royal envido.</strong> Worth 3 points.
                        <strong>Falta envido.</strong> Worth the number of points that the leading team needs to win the game. Some players bet that the winning side will also win the game, even if they are behind in the score.
                        After the team has announced Envido or Royal Envido, the opposing team has five possible responses:
                        <strong>Okay.</strong> Accepting the last bet and closing the Envido betting.
                        <strong>Envido.</strong> Raising the bet by another 2 points.
                        <strong>Royal envido.</strong> Raising the bet by another 3 points.
                        <strong>Falta envido.</strong>The number of points needed by the leading team to win the game.
                        <strong>Not Okay.</strong> Rejecting the last bet and closing the Envido betting. If the rejected bet was the first bet, the team that had made it wins 1 point. If there have been other bets, the team that has had their last bet rejected wins the points accepted up until then.
                        If the response to one of these two bets is Envido or Royal Envido, the new response is one the five mentioned, and the value of the bets goes up successively, until one of the two says Okay or Not Okay, which closes the Envido betting. With the bets finished, the players announce the value of their hands.
                        The Envido is won by whoever has the most points. In the case of a draw, priority is given to the first one who bid. The winner of the Envido must show their cards before any points are scored. If winner is mistaken then the opposing team wins, even if they have worse Envido.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Truco:</strong>Truco
                        Truco is the trick game that is played after Flor and Envido. Each partial game consists of three tricks and to win Truco it is necessary to win two of the tricks. Each player plays one of their cards, the highest card wins the trick. The “hand” leads the first trick and the following tricks are led by whoever wins the previous one, unless there is a draw, in which case the player who led that trick leads again.
                        When more than one player plays the highest card, if they are on the same team they win but if they are on opposing teams, they draw (parda). The tricks are not gathered in, but remain face up in front of the player who won them. If there is no Truco bet, the team that gets the most tricks wins, scoring 1 point. If there is a draw, the Truco bet is won by the team that wins the next trick. If all three tricks result in a draw, the “hand”’s team wins. If the first and second hands result in a draw, it is not necessary to play the third. The same is true if a team wins the first two tricks, because it has already won Truco.
                        A player can bid Truco at any time, increasing its value to 2 points. Any member of the opposing team can respond and their response is made on behalf of the whole team. The responses are <strong>Okay</strong> to accept the raise or <strong>Not Okay</strong> to admit defeat and lose 1 point.

                        <strong>Retruco.</strong> The team that answered “Okay” to Truco can say “Retruco” at any time, raising the bet to 3 points. The responses to Retruco are the same as Truco: Okay to accept and Not okay to reject it and lose 2 points.
                        <strong>Vale cuatro.</strong> When a team responds “Okay” to Retruco, they can raise the bet to 4 points by saying “Vale cuatro”. The responses to Vale cuatro are also Okay to accept and Not okay to admit losing Truco, in which case the other team scores 3 points. Vale cuatro is the highest bet in Truco No more bets can now be made and the cards have to be played to discover the winning side. Each one of the bids can only be accepted by saying Okay and only after that can Retruco be bid.
                        <strong>Played card.</strong> This means folding by placing the cards face down alongside the deck and withdrawing from the game. If only one player in the team folds, the other one has to play against the opponents with their cards. If both players fold and Truco has not been bid, the other team get 1 point.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Flor:</strong> To bid and bet Flor it is necessary to hold three cards of the same suit. This hand is worth the sum of the value of the cards plus 20 points. This hand is rare and the rules for betting on it are quite complicated. Because it depends mainly on the luck of the deal, most players prefer to play the game without it. When a player has three cards of the same suit they announce it by saying “flor”. If any other player has Flor, the team of the person with the highest Flor gets the points, plus 3 points for the Flor itself, plus 3 more for each Flor announced. The Flor is worth the sum of the value of the cards plus 20 points.</li>

            <h5>&#8226 SCORING:</h5>
            <p class="text-2">Truco is normally played to 30 points. One player one each team keeps score, totting up the points at the end of each partial game.</p>

            <h2>ESCOBA DE 15</h2>

                    <li><strong>Players:</strong> 1-5 players</li>
                    <li><strong>Deck:</strong> Spanish-shuffle of 40 cards (without 8, 9 and joker).</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> to get as many points as possible with captured cards, making combinations that add up to 15 from the upturned cards in the centre of the table.</li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <h4>Order and value of the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">The order of the cards is not important in Escoba. With respect to their value, the king is worth 10, the knight 9, the jack 8, the rest of the cards have their natural value represented by their pips.</p>
            
            <h4>Dealing the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">Each player is dealt three cards, one by one, then four cards are placed in the centre of the table, face up. The deck of remaining cards is placed to the right of the dealer. In all subsequent games, order of play is maintained from left to right.</p>
            
            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p class="text">The player to dealer's right plays first, the “hand”, placing down one of their cards in the centre of the table, trying to link this card with all or some of the upturned cards with the aim of them adding up to 15. In which case, they take those cards and place them face down by their side.</p>
            <p class="text">
                A player achieves an Escoba when the card played adds up to 15 with all of the upturned cards in the centre of the table. In this case, one of the cards is left face up in order to check the number of Escobas won at the end of the game. If a player's cards do not match any of the upturned cards in the centre. 
                To add up to 15, the player places one of their cards, face up, next to the others, and the turn passes to the next player. The game continues in strict left to right turn and each player, when their turn arrives, must play one of the cards in their hand as previously explained. When everyone has played the three cards in their hand, the dealer deals out three new cards to each player. 
                The game continues like this until all of the cards in the deck have been dealt. When the last three cards are dealt, the dealer has to announce out loud: “Last cards”. The player who got the last trick is the one who takes all of the upturned cards in the centre of the table, these must add up to 10, 25, 40 or 55 by way of proving that there have been no errors made during the game. 
                If there has been an error, the tricks of each player have to be checked and the penalty described below has to be applied. When the player who deals the cards places four upturned cards in the centre of the table and sees that these add up to 15 or 15 plus 15, the dealer takes these for themself, getting one or two Escobas respectively, with no need to deal out another four cards from the deck. 
                The lead player begins the game in the way described above. If the opponent has not made any tricks, they lose the whole game.

                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Meld an entire hand of cards before your opponents and show them all at once, based on the rules explained below.</li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <h4>Order and value of the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">Using a 48 card deck, the value of each cards is their pip value.</p>
            
            <h4>Dealing the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">Each player draws one card from the pack, the “hand” being whoever draws the highest card. The player to the left of the “hand” deals each player seven cards, one at a time, placing the next card face up on the table next to the stock deck to start the discard pile.</p>
            
            <h4>Hands:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                Each player tries to use the cards in their hand to form groups of cards of the same rank or runs of the same suit.
                For both the groups of equal cards and the runs to be deemed valid, they must be formed by at least three cards. In runs, the ace can only link with two, three, etc., and king with knight, jack, etc.. When a player melds all seven cards in their hand, this is called Chinchón.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                The “hand” starts the game, who can choose to take the upturned card off the table or, if they wish, the top card off the stock deck. Next, they discard one of their cards, placing it face up to their right, in case the next player is interested in taking it, and this ends the player’s turn. The next player can choose between taking the card discarded by the “hand” or the top card from the stock deck, discarding one of their own cards and so on with each subsequent player.
                A player can fold when they only have one or more unmatched cards in their hand worth a total value of no more than 5 points.. When folding, the player displays all the combined cards on the table, retaining the non-combined cards in their hand. The other players, in turn, may add any non-combined cards they may hold to the melds played by the one who folded, either to the trios or the runs in ascending or descending order. When playing with two decks, the runs are completed strictly from left to right and no more than one card of each correlative value can be added. Next, the following player puts down their combinations, with the others adding, in the form mentioned above, any cards that they may hold that they cannot meld.
                Play ends as soon as a player manages to get rid of all but one of their cards, which is used to close the game by placing it face down on the discard pile.
                The player who melds all their cards at once, Chinchón, receives a prize of 10 points and also has the advantage that no other player can place cards on their played combinations.
            </p>

            <h4>Scoring:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                Chinchón is played to 70 or 100 points. Before each game, each player adds the agreed amount into the pot. After each hand, players note down both the points scored and the value of their unmatched cards, with those players who exceed the score agreed for the game being eliminated. 
                The last player whose score has not reached the agreed total for the game wins and takes the pot.
                The player who melds all of their cards, Chinchón, discounts the 10 prize points from their score.
