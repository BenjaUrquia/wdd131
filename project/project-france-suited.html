            <h4>Order and value of the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">The order of the cards, from highest to lowest, is: ace, king (K), queen (Q), jack (J), ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and deuce. All suits have the same value, with no preference, in any poker hand.</p>
   
            <p class="text"><h4>Poker Hand Rankings:</h4>Hand Strength in Poker is determined by having the best combination of five cards set in the following order (Starting from the highest possible hand first):</p>
            
            <img class="poker-img" src="https://www.gamezy.com/card-games/poker/how-to-play-poker/images/poker.jpg" alt="Poker Hand Ranking">
            
            <h5>&#8226 Royal Flush</h5>
            <p class="text-2">The strongest poker hand is the royal flush. It consists of Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace, all of the same suit, e.g. spades.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Straight Flush</h5>
            <p class="text-2">The second strongest hand in poker is the straight flush. It is composed of five consecutive cards of the same suit. If two players have a straight flush, the one with the highest cards wins.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Four-of-a-kind</h5>
            <p class="text-2">A four-of-a-kind is four cards of the same rank, e.g. four Kings. If two players have four-of-a-kind, then the one with the highest four-of-a-kind wins. If they have the same (if four-of-a-kind is on the board), then the player with the highest fifth card wins, since a poker hand is always composed of five cards.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Full House</h5>
            <p class="text-2">A full house is a poker combination of a three-of-a-kind and a pair. If two players have a full house, then the one with the highest three-of-a-kind wins. If they have the same one, then the pair counts. A full house is still one of the best poker hands.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Flush</h5>
            <p class="text-2">Five cards of the same suit make a flush. If two players have a flush, then the one with the highest cards wins.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Straight</h5>
            <p class="text-2">Five consecutive cards are called a straight. If two players have a straight, the one with the highest cards wins.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Three-of-a-kind</h5>
            <p class="text-2">A three-of-a-kind is a poker combination of three cards of the same rank. If two players have the same three-of-a-kind, then the other cards, or both cards, determine the winner, since a poker hand is a always composed of five cards.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Two-pair</h5>
            <p class="text-2">Two-pair hands are, of course, composed of two pairs. If two players have two-pair, the rank of the higher pair determines the winner. If they have the same higher pair, then the lower one counts. If that is also the same, then the fifth card counts.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Pair</h5>
            <p class="text-2">A pair is composed of two cards of the same rank. Since winning poker hands are always composed of five cards, the other three cards are so-called "kickers". In case two players have the same pair, then the one with the highest kicker wins.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 High card</h5>
            <p class="text-2">If you don't even have a pair, then you look at the strength of your poker cards. If there are two players at showdown who don't have a pair or better, then the one with the highest cards wins.</p>

            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                Depending on the player's financial means and poker skills, they can choose between different limits. There are four betting rounds in the game, the amount bet in the first two rounds is half that of the next two rounds. So at a $1/$2 table, $1 is bet in the first two rounds and $2 in the next two rounds. In each one of these betting rounds, the maximum number of raises is four. In other words, once a player opens with an initial bet, their opponents can raise up to three times more, but always in amounts set by the table. So by following our example of a $1/$2 table, each player can risk a maximum of $4 in each one of the first two rounds, and $8 in each one of the next two.
                First of all there are the blinds. blinds are two compulsory bets, the small blind and the big blind, which must be placed during each round of the game by the two players on the dealer's left. The first player on the dealer's left has to place the small blind and the player to the left of this one has to place the big blind. The cost of the small blind is half the minimum bet and the big blind costs the equivalent of the minimum bet.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                After placing the blinds, the dealer deals each player two cards face down. During the hand, five more cards will be placed face up in the centre of the table, called community cards, shared by all the players. At the end, each player makes their poker hand by using the best combination between their two cards and the five community cards, being able to do this by using with one of their two hole cards, both or neither. With the two hole cards dealt, there is the first round of bets.
                The player sitting to the left of the one who placed the big blind starts. The options are fold, call or bet. If they decide to call, they must equal the amount of the big blind. With bet, they must raise by the minimum bet, i.e., $1 on a $1/$2 table. The betting round continues clockwise, ending with the player who placed the big blind.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text">
                If the first player has bet, the next player to speak can fold, call or raise. The turn passes to their left, concluding when all of the players have contributed the same amount of money to the pot, with those who have decided to fold having done so. If one player raises and no other players match the bet, they automatically win the hand and take the money from the pot.
                The Flop. Those players who continue in the game then see the Flop, which are the first three community cards of the five from which the hand will be made. Next, there is another round of betting. This time the player who is sitting immediately to the left of the dealer starts. They can choose to check or bet. If the player checks, they retain the right to call or raise during their next turn in the same round. With bet, they must place a minimum bet in the pot. The betting round continues in the same way as the previous round, now ending with the player who is acting as dealer.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                The Turn. The players who continue in the game now get to see the fourth card, called The Turn or Fourth Street. The betting round works the same way as with the Flop, with the difference that the bets are now double in value. On a $1/$2 table, after seeing the fourth card the bets go to $2.
                The River The players who continue in the game now see the fifth and last card, called The River or Fifth Street, and the betting round continues as before. At the end of the turn, those players who remain in the game compare their hands and whoever has the best hand takes the pot.
                In the next hand, the turn to be dealer passes to the player on left.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Players:</strong> 1-7</li>
                    <li><strong>Deck:</strong> France-shuffle of 52 cards (multiple decks may be used).</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Beat the dealer by having a hand closer to 21</li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <p>In Blackjack, everyone plays against the dealer. Players receive all cards face up and the dealer's first card is face up and the second is face down. The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21. If a hand goes over 21, it is called a “bust” or “break” and the wager is lost. In 21, Jacks, Queens, Kings and 10s count as 10. An Ace may be played as a one or an 11. All other cards are played at face value.</p>

            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                When you receive your first two cards, you may either “stand” or “hit.” When you “stand” it means you feel you are close enough to 21 and no longer wish any additional cards and indicated by waving off with your hand. If you wish to receive another card or “hit,” tap or scratch the table behind your wager with your finger.  In either situation, you will never touch the cards, everything is communicated using hand signals. You may draw as many cards as you want until you are close to 21 or until you “bust.”
                If you are closer to 21 than the dealer, you win and are paid an amount equal to your original wager. If your hand is less than the dealer's, you lose. If the dealer's hand “busts” or “breaks,” you win as well. Ties are a standoff or “push” and your bet remains on the table.
                If your initial two cards total 21, any Ace with a 10, Jack, Queen, or King, you have a Blackjack. Blackjack is paid either 6 to 5 or 3 to 2 depending on the type of Blackjack you are playing.
            </p>

            <h4>21 in the first 2 cards:</h4>
            If you takes 21 in your first two cards then you have many options to choose from:

            <h5>&#8226 Splitting Pairs</h5>
            <p class="text-2">If your first two cards have the same numerical value, you may split them into two hands. The bet on the second hand must equal the original bet. If the split pair is Aces, you are limited to a one-card draw on each hand.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Doubling Down</h5>
            <p class="text-2">After receiving your first two cards you may elect to wager an additional amount not to exceed the value of the original bet. With a double down, you will be dealt one additional card only.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Insurance</h5>
            <p class="text-2">If the dealer's face up card is an Ace, you may elect to take insurance. The insurance bet is a wager that the dealer has a blackjack. You may bet up to one half of your original bet. Insurance bets pay 2 to 1 if the dealer has a blackjack, but lose in all other instances.</p>
            
            <h5>&#8226 Surrender</h5>
            <p class="text-2">Players have the option of surrendering one half of their original wager after receiving their first two cards. If you surrender your cards, the dealer will take half of your wager.</p>

                    <li><strong>Deck:</strong> France-shuffle of 50 cards (No Jokers).</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To be the player with the lowest score at the end of the game, avoiding penalty points by strategically playing cards. When one player hits the agreed-upon score or higher, the game ends; and the player with the lowest score wins.</li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <p>Hearts is a trick-taking card game where the goal is to avoid taking certain cards, especially the Queen of Spades and any hearts, which carry penalty points. The player with the fewest points at the end wins.</p>

            <h4>Dealing the cards:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                When starting a game of Hearts, each player is dealt the same number of cards. Each player receives 13 cards. The Jokers are excluded from the deck.            
                After the cards have been dealt, each player chooses three cards to pass to an opponent. Players pick their cards after they've looked at them, and before they've received cards from their opponents. Cards are passed to the right at the first deal, to the left with the second, and across with the third. At the fourth deal, players keep their own cards.
            <p>

            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                The player holding the 2 of clubs after the pass makes the opening lead. If the 2 has been removed for the three handed game, then the 3 of clubs is led.
                Each player must follow suit if possible. If a player is void of the suit led, a card of any other suit may be discarded. However, if a player has no clubs when the first trick is led, a heart or the queen of spades cannot be discarded. The highest card of the suit led wins a trick and the winner of that trick leads next. There is no trump suit.
                The winner of the trick collects it and places it face down. Hearts may not be led until a heart or the queen of spades has been discarded. The queen does not have to be discarded at the first opportunity.
                
            <p>
            <h4>Scores:</h4>
            <p class="text">After all the cards have been played, players count up their tricks. Each player receives a penalty point for each heart card they have. The player who ends up with the Queen of Spades gets 13 points.</p>

            <h5>&#8226 Shooting the Moon</h5>
            <p class="text-2">However if a player wins all of the penalty cards (13 hearts and the Queen of Spades), that player gets 0 points and all opponents get 26 points. This move is called Shooting the Moon.</p>
